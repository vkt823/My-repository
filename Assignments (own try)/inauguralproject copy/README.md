# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

**In this project** we analyze the relation between men versus women wage compared to the relatively hours worked at home. Further, we analyze how different productivities and degree of elasticity of substitution can change the results.

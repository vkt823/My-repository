    "outside the labour market, unemployed or employed. This model is a\n",
    "generalization of the logit model we looked at in problem set 9 (binary\n",

    "utility model, where taste shocks follow an extreme value type 1\n",

    "that the error terms $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ are not in the dataset. \n",
